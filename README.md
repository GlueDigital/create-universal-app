# create-universal-app

This package includes the global command for Create Universal App.

## About

This project is inspired on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so take a look at their work first.

Real world apps require a lot of things not present on a basic scaffold for beginners, so we decided to make a more opinionated one with the tools we consider necessary nowadays on any new React development.

This includes, among others:
- Server side rendering, using Koa
- Internationalization support, with react-intl
- State management, via Redux

All the goodness from the original simple creator are here too, including ES6 support and other development tools.

## Usage

To create a new project using yarn, just do:

> yarn create universal-app <my-app-name>

And follow the instructions.
